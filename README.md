# KC7-Cybersecurity-Simulation-Valdoria-Election-Case-Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is based on the KC7 Cybersecurity Simulation (Valdoria Scenario).  
I acted as a Security Analyst for The Valdorian Times, investigating an unauthorized news article published during a heated political election.  
The objective was to uncover whether attackers manipulated systems to discredit political candidates and destabilize public trust.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Master basic KQL syntax: where, take, and distinct  
- Filter data to focus on relevant security events  
- Apply time-based filters to investigate suspicious activity  
- Correlate events to build a comprehensive attack timeline  
- Interpret PowerShell scripts and malicious commands used by attackers  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Kusto Query Language (KQL) – log filtering and data queries  
- Timeline Analysis – correlating events across systems  
- PowerShell Command Analysis – detecting malicious usage  
- Threat Investigation Workflows – narrowing scope to relevant data  

---

## 📂 Key Findings
- Detected unauthorized system activity leading to the publication of a false corruption article.  
- Identified malicious PowerShell scripts executed on compromised systems.  
- Correlated log events across different timestamps to reconstruct the attacker’s steps.  
- Built an attack timeline linking suspicious login attempts, PowerShell execution, and data manipulation.

## 🧩 Skills Gained
- KQL query building for security investigation  
- Log filtering and analysis  
- Timeline construction and event correlation  
- Threat detection via malicious script interpretation  
- Hands-on incident response workflow  

---

## 📖 Lessons Learned
- Querying efficiently is critical when analyzing large log datasets.  
- Correlating multiple indicators provides stronger evidence of attacker activity.  
- Attackers often leverage PowerShell as a post-exploitation tool.  
- Time-based filtering is essential to isolate relevant malicious events.
